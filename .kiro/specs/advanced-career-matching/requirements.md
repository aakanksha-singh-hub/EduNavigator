# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Career Matching system enhances the existing basic career recommendation matching logic with sophisticated algorithms that provide more accurate and nuanced career fit scores. The system will implement semantic similarity analysis, weighted scoring models, machine learning-inspired techniques, and contextual matching to significantly improve the quality of career recommendations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Semantic Similarity Matching

**User Story:** As a user receiving career recommendations, I want the system to understand the semantic meaning of my skills and interests rather than just keyword matching, so that I receive more accurate career suggestions even when I use different terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes user skills THEN it SHALL use semantic similarity algorithms to match skills with similar meanings (e.g., "JavaScript" matches with "JS", "web development", "frontend programming")
2. WHEN comparing career interests THEN the system SHALL recognize related concepts and domains (e.g., "helping people" relates to "healthcare", "education", "social work")
3. WHEN calculating skill matches THEN the system SHALL assign partial scores for related skills rather than binary matches
4. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL normalize and standardize terminology to improve matching accuracy
5. IF a user has skills in related technologies THEN the system SHALL recognize transferable skills and weight them appropriately

### Requirement 2: Weighted Multi-Factor Scoring Model

**User Story:** As a user with diverse interests and skills, I want the career matching system to intelligently weight different factors based on my profile completeness and preferences, so that recommendations reflect what matters most to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating fit scores THEN the system SHALL use dynamic weighting based on data availability and user preferences
2. WHEN a user has completed a career assessment THEN the system SHALL weight assessment data more heavily than basic profile information
3. WHEN a user has extensive work experience THEN the system SHALL prioritize experience relevance over educational background
4. WHEN multiple factors contribute to a score THEN the system SHALL use configurable weights that can be adjusted based on user feedback
5. IF certain data is missing THEN the system SHALL adjust weights dynamically to compensate and maintain scoring accuracy

### Requirement 3: Experience and Skill Level Analysis

**User Story:** As a user at a specific career stage, I want the matching system to consider my experience level and skill proficiency when recommending careers, so that suggestions are realistic and achievable for my current situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user experience THEN the system SHALL calculate experience relevance based on role similarity, industry overlap, and skill transferability
2. WHEN evaluating skill matches THEN the system SHALL consider skill proficiency levels and learning curve requirements
3. WHEN recommending careers THEN the system SHALL factor in realistic career progression paths from the user's current position
4. WHEN calculating fit scores THEN the system SHALL penalize careers that require significantly more experience than the user possesses
5. IF a user is changing careers THEN the system SHALL identify and weight transferable skills appropriately

### Requirement 4: Contextual and Temporal Matching

**User Story:** As a user with specific career goals and timelines, I want the matching system to consider my career context, location preferences, and timeline constraints, so that recommendations are practical and achievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider job market conditions and demand in the user's preferred locations
2. WHEN a user specifies timeline constraints THEN the system SHALL factor in typical career transition timeframes and learning requirements
3. WHEN evaluating career fit THEN the system SHALL consider salary expectations, work-life balance preferences, and career growth goals
4. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL adjust for industry trends and future job market projections
5. IF a user has geographic constraints THEN the system SHALL weight remote work availability and local job market conditions

### Requirement 5: Continuous Learning and Feedback Integration

**User Story:** As a user interacting with career recommendations over time, I want the system to learn from my feedback and choices to improve future recommendations, so that the matching becomes more personalized and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides feedback on recommendations THEN the system SHALL store and analyze feedback patterns to improve future scoring
2. WHEN a user selects or rejects career paths THEN the system SHALL adjust matching algorithms based on these preferences
3. WHEN generating new recommendations THEN the system SHALL incorporate historical user behavior and feedback into scoring calculations
4. WHEN similar users make career choices THEN the system SHALL use collaborative filtering techniques to enhance recommendations
5. IF recommendation accuracy improves over time THEN the system SHALL track and report matching performance metrics

### Requirement 6: Advanced Skill Gap Analysis

**User Story:** As a user exploring career options, I want the system to provide detailed analysis of skill gaps and learning requirements, so that I can understand exactly what I need to develop for each career path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing skill gaps THEN the system SHALL categorize missing skills by importance, difficulty, and time to acquire
2. WHEN calculating learning requirements THEN the system SHALL estimate realistic timeframes based on skill complexity and user's learning capacity
3. WHEN presenting skill gaps THEN the system SHALL identify prerequisite skills and optimal learning sequences
4. WHEN evaluating career readiness THEN the system SHALL provide percentage-based readiness scores for different career aspects
5. IF a user has partial knowledge in an area THEN the system SHALL calculate incremental learning requirements rather than treating it as completely missing

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of the career matching system, I want recommendations to be generated quickly and efficiently, so that I can explore multiple career options without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating career recommendations THEN the system SHALL complete calculations within 3 seconds for standard profiles
2. WHEN processing complex profiles with extensive data THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 10 seconds
3. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN performance SHALL remain consistent without degradation
4. WHEN caching recommendations THEN the system SHALL invalidate cache appropriately when user data changes significantly
5. IF the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade to simpler algorithms while maintaining functionality
