# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clickable Learning Links feature enhances the AI Career Mentor platform by adding interactive, clickable links to external learning platforms (Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, etc.) within the learning recommendations and roadmaps. This feature transforms static learning suggestions into actionable resources that users can immediately access, improving user engagement and learning pathway completion rates.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Learning Platform Link Integration

**User Story:** As a student viewing my learning roadmap, I want to see clickable links to relevant courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera, so that I can immediately access and enroll in recommended learning resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views learning recommendations THEN the system SHALL display clickable links to external learning platforms for each suggested course or resource
2. WHEN a learning resource has multiple platform options THEN the system SHALL show links to all available platforms (Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, etc.)
3. WHEN a user clicks on a learning platform link THEN the system SHALL open the external platform in a new tab/window to preserve the user's current session
4. WHEN displaying platform links THEN the system SHALL include recognizable platform logos and clear labels (e.g., "View on Udemy", "Enroll on Coursera")
5. IF a specific course link is not available THEN the system SHALL provide a general search link to the platform with relevant keywords

### Requirement 2: Platform-Specific Link Generation

**User Story:** As a user exploring different learning options, I want the system to intelligently match learning recommendations with appropriate platforms, so that I can find the most relevant courses for my skill development needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating learning recommendations THEN the system SHALL map skills and topics to appropriate learning platforms based on platform strengths
2. WHEN a course topic is technical/programming THEN the system SHALL prioritize platforms like Udemy, Pluralsight, and Coursera
3. WHEN a course topic is business/soft skills THEN the system SHALL include LinkedIn Learning and MasterClass options
4. WHEN a course topic is academic/certification THEN the system SHALL prioritize Coursera and edX university partnerships
5. WHEN no specific course is found THEN the system SHALL generate search URLs with relevant keywords for each platform

### Requirement 3: Link Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to track which learning platform links are most popular with users, so that I can optimize recommendations and understand user preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a learning platform link THEN the system SHALL log the click event with platform name, course topic, and user context
2. WHEN tracking link clicks THEN the system SHALL maintain user privacy and not store personally identifiable information
3. WHEN displaying learning recommendations THEN the system SHALL show popularity indicators based on aggregated click data
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide insights on most popular platforms and course topics
5. IF a platform link consistently receives low engagement THEN the system SHALL deprioritize that platform in future recommendations

### Requirement 4: Fallback and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user accessing learning links, I want the system to handle broken or unavailable links gracefully, so that I always have alternative options to continue my learning journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a learning platform link is unavailable or broken THEN the system SHALL provide alternative platform options for the same topic
2. WHEN external platforms are temporarily inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message with alternative suggestions
3. WHEN a specific course is no longer available THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest similar courses on the same or different platforms
4. WHEN platform APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to general platform search links with relevant keywords
5. IF all external links fail THEN the system SHALL provide internal learning resources or documentation as backup options

### Requirement 5: Mobile and Accessibility Support

**User Story:** As a mobile user or user with accessibility needs, I want learning platform links to work seamlessly across all devices and assistive technologies, so that I can access learning resources regardless of how I interact with the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing learning links on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure links open appropriately in mobile browsers or native apps when available
2. WHEN using screen readers or assistive technologies THEN the system SHALL provide clear, descriptive link text and ARIA labels for all learning platform links
3. WHEN displaying multiple platform options THEN the system SHALL maintain clear visual hierarchy and keyboard navigation support
4. WHEN links are focused via keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators
5. IF a platform has a mobile app THEN the system SHALL detect the device and provide options to open in the app or browser

### Requirement 6: Platform Integration and Updates

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the learning platform integration to be maintainable and easily updatable, so that new platforms can be added and existing ones can be modified without major code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new learning platforms THEN the system SHALL support configuration-based platform addition without code changes
2. WHEN platform URLs or APIs change THEN the system SHALL allow easy updates through configuration files
3. WHEN platforms update their branding or logos THEN the system SHALL support asset updates without requiring code deployment
4. WHEN new course categories are added THEN the system SHALL automatically map them to appropriate platforms based on predefined rules
5. IF a platform becomes unavailable or discontinued THEN the system SHALL allow easy removal and automatic fallback to alternative platforms
