Machine Learning Fundamentals

Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

Common supervised learning algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

Common unsupervised learning techniques include:
- Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Association Rules
- Anomaly Detection

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Key components of reinforcement learning:
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world in which the agent operates
- Action: What the agent can do
- Reward: Feedback from the environment
- Policy: The strategy that the agent employs to determine actions

Applications of Machine Learning
Machine learning has numerous applications across various industries:

Healthcare: Diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized treatment
Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, credit scoring
Transportation: Autonomous vehicles, route optimization
Technology: Recommendation systems, natural language processing, computer vision
Marketing: Customer segmentation, predictive analytics, personalized advertising
